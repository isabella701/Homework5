# An investor sued his broker for lack of diversification. 
# Below are the rates of return (in percent) for the investor’s portfolio over 39 months (data from Moore, McCabe, and Craig (2017)). 
# The average of the S&P 500 stock index for the same period was 0.95%. Does the broker perform worse than average? 

Stockreturns <- c(-8.36,   1.63,  -2.27, -2.93,  -2.70, 
                  -2.93, -9.14, -2.64, 6.82,   -2.35, 
                  -3.58,   6.13,   7.00, -15.25, -8.66,
                  -1.03, -9.16,  -1.25, -1.22,  -10.27,
                  -5.11, -0.80,  -1.44,  1.28,  -0.65,
                  4.34,   12.22, -7.21, -0.09, 7.34, 
                  5.04,  -7.24,  -2.14, -1.01,  -1.41, 
                  12.03, -2.53,  4.33,  1.35)
Stockreturns

# 1) Use and show R code to find the mean of the sample data.
mean(Stockreturns)

# 2) Use and show R code to find the standard deviation of the sample data
sd(Stockreturns)

# 3) Assuming a normal distribution, use and show R code to find the proportion of returns that are less than  -1.5.
pnorm(q = -1.5, mean = -1.124615, sd = 5.977673) 

# 4) Assuming a normal distribution, use and show R code to find return value that is above 70% of the returns
qnorm(p = 0.70, mean = -1.124615, sd = 5.977673)

# 5) Use and show R code to find Q1 for the data.
summary(Stockreturns)
# Q1 is -3.255

# 6) Explore the data by producing and examining a boxplot and checking for normality.
boxplot(Stockreturns)
qqnorm(Stockreturns)
qqline(Stockreturns)
# The Stockreturns data contains outliers and the qqplot shows that the points do not fully follow the line.
# This is something to consider moving forward.

# 7) State the appropriate null and alternative hypothesis required for the appropriate t test.
# H(0) :  µ = .95
# H(A) :  µ < .95

# 8) Use and show R code that will output the needed p value and confidence interval to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected.
t.test(Stockreturns,mu=.95, alternative = "less", conf.level = .95)
# CI = -infinity to 0.489
# p-value = 0.01827

# 9) Now answer the question originally stated. Does the broker perform worse than average? (Explain or justify in two or three sentences)
# With a p-value of 0.01827, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
# This means that the broker performs worse than average. Also, the 95% confidence interval does not contain .95.
